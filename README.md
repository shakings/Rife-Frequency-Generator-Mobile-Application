# Rife-Frequency-Generator-Programming-Interface
American scientist Royal Raymond Rife invented the Rife machine. It produces an energy similar to radio waves.   Rife’s machine built on the work of Dr. Albert Abrams. Abrams believed every disease has its own electromagnetic frequency. He suggested doctors could kill diseased or cancerous cells by sending an electrical impulse identical to the cell’s unique electromagnetic frequency. This theory is sometimes called radionics.
